It encourages one to use the knowledge they have.

So, if God gives you a gift,
for example, my linguistic ability,
then I should use it.

And it's a waste, just to stay at home and do nothing about it.

So, I feel it's my duty,
since I have a reasonable amount of linguistic ability
to either teach English or use it to benefit my kind.
